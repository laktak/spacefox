# SpaceFox

SpaceFox manages browser tabs. Each window is a space that can be closed and restored on demand.

It works just like the "Restore previous session on startup" (FireFox) and "Continue where you left off" (Chrome) but with multiple named spaces.

When you start a new topic (like how to solve a problem)
- you open a new window,
- add it to SpaceFox
- and start browsing.

During your search you may end up with a lot of tabs but you can always close the window and open it again later to continue where you left.
